## üõ†Ô∏è List of Solo Fixes

- Fixed case sensitivity issue with file types in the Python File Mover [code](https://github.com/AustinCGomez/Python-File-Mover), accepted in [this PR](https://github.com/AustinCGomez/Python-File-Mover/pull/60). (Merged)
- Fixed a bug causing a stray 'U' to appear in the front-end for the TEN-Agent project [code](https://github.com/TEN-framework/TEN-Agent/), accepted in [this PR](https://github.com/TEN-framework/TEN-Agent/issues/407). (Merged)
- Fixed a bug causing the text file to not be parsed into a PDF properly for the travelitinerary [code](https://github.com/gloriapul/travelitinerary/tree/pdf-fix).  The issue was that the text file was being read using UTF-8 encoding, which was causing the PDF to be empty.  I changed the encoding to Latin-1, which fixed the issue.[here](https://ibb.co/Sc73zwL)

## ü§ù Group Fix
Describe your group project contributions in 3-4 sentences, highlighting the process and what you learned.

- For our group fix, Zahir, Ons, and I worked together to add degree centrality support to the RustworkX library.  In the beginning, we encountered a few challenges, including figuring out how to calculate the centrality of a directed graph and how to handle graphs with removed edges. The pull request for this feature can be found [here](https://github.com/Qiskit/rustworkx/pull/1306). (Merged)

## üìö Learnings

This course provided me with a comprehensive understanding of working with open-source projects and managing larger-scale software setups. I also gained a better understanding of GitHub and its features such as pull requests, adding useful bug comments to your commits, and how to properly navigate the codebase. 

Some of the key things that I learned in this class include:
- Setting up a large codebase on a local machine
- Deepening my understanding of GitHub: Mastering features like pull requests, useful commit messages, and branch management.
- How to effectively debug front-end issues using Google Chrome's developer tools

The second solo bug fix particularly stood out as a challenge and a learning experience. It involved addressing a problem where a React library unnecessarily re-rendered the "U" avatar. Though the solution seemed straightforward in hindsight, pinpointing the issue required diving into complex re-rendering logic and navigating dependencies in the React codebase.

While the course was rewarding, it was not without its hurdles. The first major challenge was setting up the initial environment for a large project. Dependency mismatches and versioning issues delayed progress at times. Another challenge was understanding large codebases. Many open-source projects lack extensive documentation, requiring time and effort to fully understand the codebase. I wish I had explored testing frameworks more thoroughly to enhance the reliability of my contributions through unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. 

Moving forward, I would like to continue exploring open-source projects. In addition to continuing to contribute to the RustworkX library, I intend on contributing more to ML code spaces on top of Software Engineering. Again,I feel incredibly lucky to have had the opportunity to take this class as an undergraduate, as it has given me industry-similar experience and enhanced my github profile.
