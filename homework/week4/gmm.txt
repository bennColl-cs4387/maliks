"There's no one answering the door. Obviously you won't break in because you don't have a warrant or
anything. But nothing's wrong with looking around the place...

You check around the house, there's no car. Not even a driveway. You do find a bike resting against
the fence. It's pretty close to the factory, so makes sense the suspect bikes to work.

Just to make sure, you ask some of the neighbors, they confirm that the suspect doesn't own a car.
One of them says he doesn't even have a license.

Another neighbor says he saw the suspect coming back from work on the day of the murder at about
5PM, they chatted for a bit before his sister picked him up to visit their parents. They live pretty
far away, so that places him away from Git Town at the time of the murder."

    No one's home...
    
    You can take a look around though.

"Nobody's home. From the stack of letters in the mailbox nobody's been here for a good few days.

Without a warrant you can't get into the house, but you can still checkout the area. Maybe talk with
some of the neighbors.

The guy next door says he barely ever spoke to the suspect, "was a bit of a loner" is what he says.
Doesn't know what type of vehicle he drives.

You take a stroll around the house, there's a back porch that probably seen better days. You spot a
driveway next to it leading to a garage. The door's open and you see a green Hyundai parked there."

    Yeah, of course I used the backdoor to the factory, that's the closest entrance to the freezer and I
    brought in some ingrediants that can't really stand the heat.
    
    At the time of the murder I was at a block party right down the street from here, we threw the party
    for one of the neighbors who got back from the hospital after an accident. I was with my kids. You
    can ask anyone who's been there.
    
    Oh wait, you know what? We took a picture... Let me get my phone.
    
    See? That's me, that's the neighbor, here's my little girl. And you see the timestamp?
    
    So yeah, I really don't have anything to do with that... Barely knew the victim...
    
    But you know what? I did see someone rushing out of the factory... He got into a green Hyundai, you
    don't see many of those around here... Probably a rental. I didn't catch his face, was just weird
    seeing someone running off like that... Come to think about it, maybe that person had something to
    do with it?
    
    Anyways, best of luck catching whoever did it!

You ask around with the neighbors, just to make sure. Everyone you ask verify that suspect's alibi.



$ echo "Cosmo Siwkonk" | git hash-object --stdin | grep -iq -f /dev/stdin <(git show solution) && echo 'You found the murderer!' || echo 'No cigar, chief... Try again.'
You found the murderer!
