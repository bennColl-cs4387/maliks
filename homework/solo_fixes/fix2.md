# Bug Fix Report: Unfriendly Icon Representation

## Repo Description

TEN Agent is a multimodal agent that leverages the OpenAI Realtime API to provide real-time interactions across various modalities. It integrates features such as weather checks, web search, and vision capabilities, enhancing user experience through dynamic and responsive functionalities.

## Issue Overview
The issue was identified in the user interface of the TEN Agent, where the icon representing "You" was displayed as the letter "U." This was reported in issue #407 by user @cyfyifanchen.

## Bug Description
The current implementation of the UI icon does not provide a friendly or inviting appearance, which negatively impacts the user experience during interactions with the agent.

## Progress
I've just set up the project on my native system, and my next step is to get familar more with the frontend code which is written in Typescript, and implement the fix. I'm planning to make a pull request by today as the error seems to exists in their deployment online. [check here](https://agent.theten.ai/)
