# Fixing Avatar Issue in Messages

Here is the issue: [Unfriendly Icon Representation - Issue #407](https://github.com/TEN-framework/TEN-Agent/issues/407)
## Problem:
the issue where a "U" (for User) was  shown in the avatar fallback, even when I tried to remove it. I needed a way to show avatars only for specific messages.

## First Try:
I tried changing the fallback text in the `AvatarFallback` to `null` or an empty string, but it still showed the "U" in the avatar. The fallback was being triggered from Redux, so this didnâ€™t work.

## Debugging:
I checked the `uid` in the message data, which looked like this:
```ts
export interface ITextItem {
  uid: string;
  text: string;
  time: number;
  isFinal: boolean;
}
```
I then went ahead, and assigned '1' to Agent as user id and added a conditional check in the `AvatarFallback` to show the avatar only if the `uid` is '1'. Making sure the avatar is shown only for Agent messages and not for User messages.

Here is the code for the fix:

```
const isAgent = data.uid === "1" // agent's uid is "1"

  return (
    <div
      className={cn("flex items-start gap-2", {
        "flex-row-reverse": data.type === EMessageType.USER, // User messages are on the right
      })}
    >
      {/* Render avatar only for the agent */}
      {isAgent ? (
        <Avatar>
          <AvatarFallback>AG</AvatarFallback>
        </Avatar>
      ) : (
        <div className="w-10 h-10" /> // Empty space for the user (no avatar)
      )}

      {/* Message content */}
      <div className="max-w-[80%] rounded-lg bg-secondary p-2 text-secondary-foreground">
        <p>{data.text}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```
I'll make a pull request for this fix soon by following the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/TEN-framework/TEN-Agent/blob/main/README.md)
